        <p>Hi there, I'm Kağan! Currently, I'm a first-year student studying computer engineering at Istanbul Technical University. Originally from Malatya, I have a diverse set of interests, including music appreciation, drawing, coding, and exploring new places.</p>
        <p>My academic interests consist mainly of computer science, especially computer architecture and low-level programming. I also am interested in math and science, especially chemistry and physics. I think these fields are quite entertaining.</p>
